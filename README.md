# Project3_Zeta
CSCE 331 Project 3 Group Zeta

The Zeta group consists of: Noah Hahn, Amine Sakrout, Isaiah Munoz, Yezen Hijazin, and Joel Herzog

In this project we will build a ordering system for Spin and Stone that has three different views, one for the cashier, one for the manager, and one for the customer. This project will blends different existing web components to solve a problem of your POS's prototype front end in a novel way.
